## Main Objective
Develop a voice enabled intelligent assistant for programming.

## Main Research Questions
1. How to identify input issued in Natural Language?
2. How to manipulate code in a humanlike way?
3. How to provide proper audio feedback?
4. How to provide proper visual feedback?


## Individual Research Questions

### A.M.W.W.R.L. Wataketiya (IT19014128)
1. How to understand natural language input?
2. How to process programming related natural language input?
3. How to synchronize a dialogue?

### H.A.R. Kithsiri (IT19238418)
1. How to parse the code base by a language agnostic approach
2. How to generate the source code by using parsed source code.
 

### S.A.N.L.D. Chandrasiri(IT19180526)
1. How to understand dialogue?
2. How to generate meaningful natural dialogue?
3. How to maintain speech generation?


### H.G. Malwatta (IT19240848)
1. How to create User Interface to show microphone activity and suggestions ?
2. How to place generated codes at right file location?

## Individual Objectives

### A.M.W.W.R.L. Wataketiya (IT19014128)
1. Voice Recognition
2. Input Classification
3. Input identification
4. Communicating the result and communicating with the dialogue engine

### H.A.R. Kithsiri (IT19238418)
1. Parse existing code base
2. Storing parsed source code in language agnostic way
3. Analyzing the stored source code for requested programming identifiers by IDE or other modules.
4. Modifying parsed source code
5. Regenerating the source code

### S.A.N.L.D. Chandrasiri(IT19180526)
1. Understand dialogue intents and entities
2. Generate meaningful natural dialogue
3. Synchronizing Dialogue management with Speech engine.
4. Generate natural speech feedback.



### H.G. Malwatta (IT19240848)
1. Create new user interface to the user
2. Highlight code segments when adding new code or editing existing code
3. Place code segment at correct file location

# Notes   
The resulting system will be a combination of a standalone server and an IDE extension/plugin   
Code for the standalone server and the extension will be maintained as two seperate repositories.
